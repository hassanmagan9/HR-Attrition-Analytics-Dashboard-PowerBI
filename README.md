# HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard

## Executive Summary
This project explores a dataset of 1,470 employees to identify the key drivers of workforce turnover. With a current attrition rate of *16.12%*, the analysis pinpoints high-risk segments to help HR leadership implement data-driven retention strategies.



## Tech Stack
- *Power BI*: Advanced Data Modeling & DAX  
- *Power Query*: ETL processes and data cleaning  
- *Data Visualization*: Sankey diagrams, Treemaps, and Funnel charts for multi-dimensional analysis  



## Key Strategic Insights

###  High-Risk Roles
Attrition is concentrated in *R&D and Sales, specifically among **Sales Representatives and Lab Technicians*, indicating a need for role-specific engagement strategies.

###  The "Tenure" Factor
Employees within their first *10 years* and those aged *26–35* account for the majority of exits, highlighting a gap in early-career retention.

###  Financial Impact
A strong correlation exists between lower salary brackets (*$1k–$4k*) and attrition, suggesting that compensation remains a primary driver for leaving.

### The Overtime Paradox
Over *50%* of attrited employees worked overtime, proving that workload pressure can override overall job satisfaction.



## Recommendations

1. *Compensation Benchmarking*  
   Review salary structures for junior-to-mid-level roles to remain competitive.

2. *Burnout Prevention*  
   Implement strict monitoring of overtime hours to reduce turnover among "satisfied" but overworked staff.

3. *Career Pathing*  
   Enhance growth opportunities for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree holders to align their career goals with long-term company retention.
